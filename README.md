#### This project is designed to automate the comparison of various machine learning algorithms on multiple datasets. 
#### It leverages the <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised" target="_blank">mljar-supervised</a> AutoML library to build models and compares their performance on both classification and regression tasks. 
#### The project enables automated model training, evaluation, leaderboard creation, and the generation of comparison plots between different algorithms.

<h1 align="center" id="features">Features ‚Ñπ</h1>

### 1. Dataset Fetching:
- The project uses the `fetch_openml` function from sklearn.datasets to download various datasets from `OpenML`.
- Datasets are categorized into three types: regression, binary classification, and multiclass classification, with `RMSE` used as the evaluation metric for regression tasks and `accuracy` used for both binary and multiclass classification tasks.
  
### 2. Model Generation:
- The `generate_models()` function automates the training of different algorithms (
            Baseline,
            Linear,
            CatBoost,
            Decision Tree,
            Extra Trees,
            LightGBM,
            Neural Network,
            Random Forest,
            Xgboost) across a variety of datasets.
- All models were trained with advanced feature engineering disabled and without ensembling. A 5-fold cross-validation with shuffle and stratification (for classification tasks) was applied. During training, various hyperparameter configurations (where applicable) were explored for each algorithm.
- Results of the best-performing models are logged in a leaderboard and saved to a CSV file.

### 3. Leaderboard:
- The project generates a leaderboard that tracks the performance of each algorithm on each dataset. Metrics like accuracy or RMSE are used, depending on the type of task (classification or regression).

### 4. Algorithm Comparison:
- The `compare()` function reads the leaderboard data and performs pairwise comparisons between algorithms across datasets.
- The comparison between algorithms is based on a scoring system that evaluates performance across binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression tasks. Scores are assigned for each category, and the algorithm with the highest overall score is declared the winner.
- The comparison results are saved as JSON files and plots for further analysis.

### 5. Report Generation:
- A Markdown file is generated for each algorithm comparison, including details on the datasets used, the metrics, and the winning algorithm. This makes it easy to publish the results in a user-friendly format for documentation or presentation.
